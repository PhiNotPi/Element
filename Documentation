This is a language that I invented in early 2012 to be a simple golfing language. By this, I mean that there is very little to no operator overloading. The operators are also simpler and fewer in number than most modern golfing languages.

The most interesting features of this language are its data structures. There are two stacks and a hash that are used to store information.

The m-stack is the main stack, where arithmetic and most other operations take place. When data is inputted or printed, this is where it goes or is retrieved from.

The c-stack is the control stack. This is where boolean arithmetic takes place. The top values of the c-stack are used by If and While loops as the condition.

The hash is where variables are stored. The ; and ~ store and retrieve data from the hash, respectively.

Element is a very weakly typed language. It uses Perl's ability to freely interpret numbers as strings and vice-versa.


OP    the operator.  Each operator is a single character
STACK tells what stacks are affected and how many are popped or pushed
      "o" stands for "other effect"
HASH  tells if it involves the hash
x & y represent two values that are already on the stack, so the effect of
      the operator can be more easily described

OP     STACK  HASH   DESCRIPTION
text     ->m         --whenever a bare word appears, it pushes that string onto 
                       the main stack
_       o->m         --inputs a word and pushes onto main stack
`       m->o         --output.  pops from main stack and prints
xy;    mm->    yes   --variable assignment.  the top stack element y is assigned 
                       the value x
~       m->m   yes   --variable retrieval.  pops from main stack, pushes contents 
                       of the element with that name
x?      m->c         --test. pops x and pushes 0 onto control stack if x is '0' or 
                       an empty string, else pushes 1
><=     m->c         --comparison. pops two numbers off of stack and performs 
                       test, pushes 1 onto control stack if true and 0 if false
'       m->c         --pops from main stack and pushes onto control stack
"       c->m         --pops from control stack and pushes onto main stack
&|     cc->c         --AND/OR. pops two items from control stack, performs and/or 
                       respectively, and pushes result back onto control stack
!       c->c         --NOT. pops a number off of control stack, pushes 1 if 0 or 
                       empty string, 0 otherwise
[]       c           --FOR statement (view the top number number from control stack 
                       and eval those many times)
{}       c           --WHILE (loop until top number on control stack is 0, also 
                       does not pop)
#       m->          --discard. pops from main stack and destroys
(       m->mm        --pops from main stack, removes first character, pushes the 
                       remaining string onto stack, and pushes the removed character 
                       onto stack
)       m->mm        --pops from main stack, removes last character, pushes the 
                       remaining string onto stack, and pushes the removed character 
                       onto stack
+-*/%^ mm->m         --arithmetic. pops two most recent items, adds/negates
                       /multiplies/divides/modulates/exponentiates them, and places 
                       the result on the stack 
xy@    mm->o         --move. pops x and y and moves xth thing in stack to move to 
                       place y in stack
x$      m->m         --length. pops x and pushs length of x onto the stack
xy:    mm->o         --duplication. pops x and y and pushes x onto the stack y times
xy.    mm->m         --concatination. pops x and y and pushes x concatonated with y
\        o           --escapes out of next character, so it isn't an operator and can
                       be pushed onto the stack
,      m->mm         --character conversion. pops from main stack, coverts it to char
                       and pushes, and converts to num and pushes
Newlines and spaces separate different elements to be pushed 
onto the stack individually, but can pushed onto the stack using \
